## Overview
This repository contains the codes for the paper "Learned codes for broadcast channels with feedback". 

## Prerequisites
Python environment:
- Python 3.10.8
- numpy: 1.23.4
- pytorch: 1.12.1


The implementation is largely based on "[generalized block attention feedback (GBAF) ](https://github.com/emre1925/GBAF)." and "[Lightcode](https://github.com/sravan-ankireddy/lightcode)." 

Thank the authors for sharing their codes.
